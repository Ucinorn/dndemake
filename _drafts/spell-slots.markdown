* Spell slots are an integral part of the game and are used by the majority of classes

* Spell slots violate one of our core rules of simplification: the use of static number tracking and lookup tables

  * The best way to simplify the use of spells slots for players is to reduce them down to a consistent global rule

  * Our goal is to reduce the complexity of spellcasting down to deciding which spell to cast where, not assessing the

* Spell slots also introduce a whole host of complications for bth the player and dungeon master in playing and balancing the game respectively:

  * Managing spell slots across time and encounters is a fully fledged resource management metagame that introduces lots of interesting strategic choices for players. It raised questions like:

    * do I risk expending high level spell slots to ensure victory here, or save them for future threats?

    * What do I think will be the next opportunity to take a long rest will be?

    * Do I upcast this low level spell to improve its effectiveness?

    * This battle might not last very long, this could be my only choice to use that cool spell I have.

  * For many players this is a core part of DnD and a large reason for its strategic depth: it makes spellcasters what they are. It encourages players to think beyond the immediate threat, and using a spell slot here or there can have consequences across hours of game time. 

  * The principle of actions and consequences are a core part of DnD and one of the reasons it is so popular: however for new players every negative consequence is an opportunity for them to become disenfranchised with the game and leave. 

  * This is especially the case if they don't fully understand the reasons for consequences: this resource management style of play is not immediately clear for users, and unless fully explained it can feel like being punished for no reason other than playing the game. 

  * It's also a log of cognitive burden in a game already laden with technicalities. It takes a long time for a player to understand the 'flow' of a typical campaign, and to therefore make meta-decisions on how to manage their resources from session to session. Some of these decisions may include:

    * Players may be hesitant to use their spell slots for fear of putting themselves or the team in a dangerous position: this may lead to them never realising the full potential of their PC and feeling like they are not as impactful as other players

    * Or the opposite could be true: new spellcasters may go all out on spell slots, dominating encounters, but then finding themselves relatively useless in subsequent

  * Spell slots also generate some meta-decisions that go to the core relationship between player and DM, potentially breaking the fourth wall. Take this scenario for example: 

    * It's the start of a session, and the players are assaulting a fortress. They have already had one encounter with enemies, dispatched relatively easily with no resources spent. The players find themselves ambushed by more enemies, in greater numbers, so it would be a good time to expend some resources. 

    * Spellcasting heroes are making the usual deliberations from their character's point of view: how many slots to I have left? Could we win this battle without powerful spells? How close are we to our goal? Do I want to do something cool here? 

    * However they are also making decisions based on their knowledge of the DM and the game as a construct. 

      * How many hours do we have left this session? 

      * Is the DM likely to push us towards our goal to get this wrapped up, or string it out into another session? 

      * If I use all my resources now and we end up fighting a powerful enemy, would the DM reduce the difficulty of the encounter to take my spell slots into account? 

      * Or let me face the consequences of my actions? 

      * Are my teammates more likely to blame me or the DM if we get killed? 

      * If we asked for an opportunity to rest would be get one? 

  * It is also arguable that the nature of spell slots are a problem for all the reasons above in general DnD play: but our focus here is on simplifying 

## Changes

We have two goals in dealing with spell slots: 

* Retain their core functionality as a measure of power level from 1 to 9

* Introduce a single global rule for determining how often a given spell 

The first idea we will explore is seen elsewhere in the game in the form of attack rolls: a chance based difficult modifier based on the skill of the players versus the defense of the enemy.  In the case of this new rule this player is rolling their spellcasting ability against the level of the spell

* When casting spells of a specific spell slot level, players must roll a d20 \+ their spellcasting modifier equal to or above that **twice **that level. 

* Attempting to cast a spell you are under-leveled for gives disadvantage, greatly increasing the risk of failure. This shouldn't be too common,

* Any abilities or magical items that increase spell slots instead reduce the difficulty of casting spells of that level by 1

* Any abilities or magical items that allow you to store spells do not require a roll when used.

  * It is assumed the player attempted the spell enough times to successfully store these spells ahead of time.  

The Power Spike Problem

But surely, I can hear you say, this means spellcasters are OP now? If they can fire off high level spells all the time, thats over the top! And surely, I can hear you say, this means spellcasters are underpowered now! They can fail to cast a spell and waste a whole turn!

There's a number of reasons this ok from a balance perspective: 

* A typical DnD encounter lasts for less than 6 rounds total, meaning the actual opportunities to cast high-impact spells are limited. 

* 

* The frequency of high level spells equals a player's appetite for risk: although they could potentially get off one max level spell every turn, the odds of them doing so are low: the same was that a fighter has a low chance of hitting max damage with every one of their attacks

There's a number of reasons this is also OK: 

*  The concept of failing an attack is already in place for players that use mostly attacks, expecially ones that attack only once. 

* The risk of failure is entirely in the player's hands, unlike 

Other thematic Benefits

This change is largely designed to simplify the rules around spell slots
