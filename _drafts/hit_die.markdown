# Summary

Hit die are a small but and rarely used rule, scattered throughout the PBH in a handful of small but specific places.  It sees a  use at character creation, during level up, and most frequently during short rests and a healing mechanic.

## Critique

Hit die are a perfect target for demaking: they demonstrate almost all the things awe are trying to minimise and remove in DnD  for a number of reasons:

* they are very specific, applying to only a few circumstances
* they are not used often
* they are a static counting mechanism, introducing one more thing to keep track of during a game
* they replicate mechanics already fulfilled by other rulesets
* their value strongly correlates to another incremental value: player level

As a result of their sparse use, hit die are ripe for demaking: as a small but distinct ruleset, they can and should be removed altogether. The material difference hit die make to HP can easily be replaced by a simple plus or minus 1 HP per level for martial and spellcasting classes respectively: this is already the case for players who choose to take HP averages on level up instead of rolling.


## Demake

Hit Die rules are removed from the game. Their effects are also removed.

But wait, I hear you say, how can you do that? What does this mean for game balance? Not very much, it turns out.
