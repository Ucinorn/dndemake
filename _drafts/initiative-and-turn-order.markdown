## Summary 

Initiative as a mechanic has a long pedigree, first appearing in version 1 of the game, and remaining relatively consistent throughout the game's history. At it's core it serves one purpose; determining who goes first in a given situation, or in contested acts that require speed and reaction. However its most common usage is to determine turn order at the beginning of combat, and heralds the swift switch in play style that goes with it. Mechanically it is identical to a standard d20 dexterity skill check, but is treated and handled separately. 

While the importance of turn order is debatable (and we'll come to that below), the importance of the switch between regular play and combat is not to be trifled with. More than most other mechanics, the call to roll for initiative has a psychological effect on players that is unseen almost anywhere else in the game. It is the equivalent of the classic record scratch sound effect, a pivot point where the core mechanics, style of thinking and even time scales change dramatically. It is the throwing of the gauntlet, and the signal for players to turn from noble negotiators to deadly warriors who show no mercy. 

As a result it hold particular significance as a pivotal part of DnD lore, been immortalised in countless memes, and turned the phrase 'roll for initiative' into a part of everyday conversation for millions. Making changes to initiative should not be taken lightly. 

## Critique 

As mentioned above

The biggest issue with Initiative and turn order is the way that it isolates players and their actions during combat. A single player turn forces them to act and move alone, rolling dice and making decisions on their own.
