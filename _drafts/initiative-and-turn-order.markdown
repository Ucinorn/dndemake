## Summary 

Initiative as a mechanic has a long pedigree, appearing in various forms in every version of DnD. At it's core it serves one purpose; determining who goes first in a given situation, or in contested acts that require speed and reaction. Mechanically it is identical to a standard d20 dexterity skill check, but is treated and handled separately. However its most common usage is to determine turn order at the beginning of combat, and heralds the swift switch in play style that goes with it. 

While the importance of turn order is debatable (and we'll come to that below), the importance of the switch between regular play and combat is not to be trifled with. More than most other mechanics, the call to roll for initiative has a psychological effect on players that is unseen almost anywhere else in the game. It is the equivalent of the classic record scratch sound effect, a pivot point where the core mechanics, style of thinking and even time scales change dramatically. It is the throwing of the gauntlet, and the signal for players to turn from noble negotiators to deadly warriors who show no mercy. 

As a result it hold particular significance as a pivotal part of DnD lore, been immortalised in countless memes, and turned the phrase 'roll for initiative' into a part of everyday conversation for millions. Making changes to initiative should not be taken lightly. 

## Critique 

The biggest issue with Initiative and turn order is the way that it isolates players and their actions during combat. A single player turn forces them to act and move alone, rolling dice and making decisions on their own. 

## Demaking


The biggest demake is removal, and in the case of initiative for speed checks, this is a relatively simple exercise; replace all initiative rolls with its closest counterpart; a normal dexterity roll. The ease that this is done highlight how initiative exists on the weight of its own pedigree, not due t its value. Its likely that the DnD designers liked the simplicity of using dexterity checks, but couldn't bring themselves to throw away the term completely.  

The main effect this has is to remove the many edge cases, effects and buffs that influence initiative only, and rely instead on dexterity as a measure of all things speedy in a character. Not only does this make sense thematically, it allows us to throw away pages of initiative rules in favour of a core mechanic; skill checks.

The only downside is losing the niche skills and effects that focus specifically on initiative, such as magical items, or class skills like those of Rangers. Given how rarely initiative is rolled, these effects are unlikely to be missed. In the event they are; they can easily be replaced by advantage on speed based dexterity checks. 

The more complicated demake is not initiative rolls itself, but the nature and purpose what comes from them most of the time; turn order. Turn order is already a simple premise, and turn taking is a core part of many board games, 

As a result, the turn order demake is more of an optional playstyle than a mandatory rule change: new players are more likely to appreciate fast rounds that all happen in real time than the ability to make complex strategic decisions. A good ide

## Rules

When a player two players make contested actions, they must roll a skill check of the GMs choosing .
