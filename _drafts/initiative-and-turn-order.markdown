## Summary 

Initiative as a mechanic has a long history, first appearing in version 1 of the game. At it's core it serves one purpose; determining who goes first in any situation, but in most games it signals the beginning of combat, and the swift switch in play style that goes with it. 

As a result it has bem=come a pivotal part of DnD lore, been immportalised in countless memes, and If DnD was a move the phrase 'Roll for Initiaive

## Critique 

As mentioned 

The biggest issue with Initiative and turn order is the way that it isolates players and their actions during combat. A single player turn forces them to act and move alone, rolling dice and making decisions on their own.
